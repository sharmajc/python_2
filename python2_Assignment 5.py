'''
Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
Instructions:
Write a recursive function factorial(n) that returns the factorial of the non-negative integer n.
The factorial of n (denoted as n!) is defined as:
n! = n * (n-1)! for n > 0
0! = 1
Write test cases to verify the function works correctly for different values of n.

def factorial(n):
    if n==0:
        return 1

    return n * factorial(n-1)

print("Factorial is: ", factorial(5))
